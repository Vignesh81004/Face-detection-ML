Face Detection Using MTCNN

📌 Overview
This project implements face detection using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks). It detects faces in single and multiple images, determines if a face is frontal or side-facing, and displays the detection accuracy.

🚀 Features
✅ Detects faces in images using MTCNN
✅ Classifies faces as frontal or side-facing
✅ Provides an accuracy score based on confidence and alignment
✅ Supports batch processing of images in a folder
✅ Displays annotated images with bounding boxes and accuracy



🛠️ Installation
1️⃣ Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

🎯 Usage
Run the script with a folder of images or a single image:
python main.py --input /path/to/image_or_folder

Example:
python main.py --input images/hollywood.jpg
